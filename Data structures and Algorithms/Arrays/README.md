Arrays

Sorting:
QuickSort: Efficient average-case time complexity (O(nlog n))
MergeSort: Stable sort, useful when order matters (O(nlog n))

Searching:
Binary Search: Fast search in sorted arrays (O(log n))

Two Pointers:
In-place manipulation, often for sorted arrays (e.g., removing duplicates)

Sliding Window:
Subarray problems, finding maximum/minimum within a window
